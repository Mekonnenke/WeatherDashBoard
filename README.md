# WeatherDashBoard
this app is developed for Server API and I used  https://openweathermap.org to develop this app and access API key,  and other
   internet sources assisted me to learn the functionality and algorithm of  this app.
   
* This app has viewed the weather  condition of major cities in the world. 
  - A user should put a correct spelling of city.
  - small citieas and towns are not available on this weather app. 
  - The app generate a five day of weather report.
  - it display temp, humidity, wind display, uv index and days.
* For a nav bar and footer section insted of bootstrap I try to use css.
